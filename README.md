# Sky test
**I'm preferring e2e test when possible**. This is a choice and can be discussed. e2e test are closer to the final user, but slower to run (one among various reason pro or against e2e). For a small project like this one speed isn't an issue.

###To run the project:
    $bower install and npm install
    $grunt serve

###To run e2e tests:
     $grunt test:e2e
